# students-list

Just do a `npm install` to install libraries and `node parser-csv-json ${fileNameAsInput}` to run the program. If no file name is passed as input, the program takes `input.csv` as input file and it will create `output.json` with the list of students.

TL;DR if you are lazy to create an input file, just run `node parser-csv-json`
